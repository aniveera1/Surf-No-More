# Surf-No-More

Surf No More is a lightweight extension that aims to help you improve your browsing productivity by informing you of your browsing habits. The goal of Surf No More is to passively encourage you to be more productive rather than actively preventing access to the Internet or time sucking websites. This ensures that any resulting increase in productivity is due to your own initiative and will be more permanent.
